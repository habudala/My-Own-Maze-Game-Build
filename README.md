### Created A Basic Maze Runner Type Game 

#### Animated the character via sprites (to add running effect)
#### Tied movement to up,down,left and right arrow buttons. 
####On key up the character freezes (the img rotation stops)
#### Laid restrictions on field and maze walls (so they can't be crossed [for phero only for now])
#### Animated the background using CSS and JavaScript animations
#### Goals: add impact detection to hero/foes;
#### Mabybe add some kind o fiish line in the middle of the maze.
